/* All executable C programs must have a "main" function of type "int"
 * The returned int of the C program becomes the exit code, where 0 is success
 * 
 * By convention, the main function has two arguments:
 *   int argc     : the number of command line arguments, including program name
 *   char **argv  : an array of strings, one for each command line argument
 *
 * Note: (char *) is an array of characters (i.e., a rudimentary string)
 *       (char *)* is an array of arrays of characters (array of strings)
 *       We will have much to say about these mysterious *'s soon
